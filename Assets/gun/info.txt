N3r-V Close Quarters Combat Rifle

Designed, modeled, unwrapped and 
textured by ~betasector.

Original 2d concept:
http://betasector.deviantart.com/art/N3r-V-Camo-test2-304535181    

All textures were hand-made, everything
on the gun was designed by me.

Feel free to use, or modify the gun,
just make sure you mention the original
creator.


Lights and the camera is on layer 2,
Layer 11 was kept for modifications,
iterations as a temp layer.

Additional accessories are on layer 3:
    -peq-2 aiming system
    -hd camera
    
These are not textured and not
unwrapped.
